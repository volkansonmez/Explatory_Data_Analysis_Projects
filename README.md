## Explatory_Data_Analysis_and_ML_Projects


#### 1- Kaggle movie dataset is analyzed with Pandas and Matplot Libraries.
Raw tmdb_5000_movies.csv dataset is cleaned, organized, and nested json files are flattened with Pandas. The tables are created with matplotlib.pyplot. There are clean instructions to follow each step for the beginners. Last update: June 15, 2020


#### 2- Framingham dataset is analyzed with Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplot Libraries. KNN, Logistic Regression Classifier, and a One Layer Neural Network are applied to the dataset.
Raw framingham.csv dataset is downloaded from Kaggle. The dataset is cleaned, the feature scoring analysis and pruning is done. 3 different ML algorithms are applied for logistic regression analysis. There are clean instructions to follow each step for the beginners. Last update: September 24, 2020


#### 3- MNIST dataset is analyzed with Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplot Libraries. Pytorch and TF-Keras libraries are used to build models with FCL and CNNs.
The dataset can be downloaded from: https://www.kaggle.com/oddrationale/mnist-in-csv for EDA. 
The dataset used for creating the models are downloaded through torchvision.datasets and keras.datasets in the ipynb attached
(See the downloads from: tf.keras.datasets.mnist and torchvision.datasets.MNIST)


#### 4- Breast Cancer dataset is analyzed with Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplot Libraries. Decision Tree & XGBoost models are trained to make a prediction with 95% and 97% accuracy respectively.
The dataset can be obtained at: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/breast+cancer+wisconsin+%28diagnostic%29
Features are computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. Data has information about 569 patients. There are 32 attributes.
