## Explatory_Data_Analysis_and_ML_Projects


#### 1- Kaggle movie dataset is analyzed with Pandas and Matplot Libraries.
Raw tmdb_5000_movies.csv dataset is cleaned, organized, and nested json files are flattened with Pandas. The tables are created with matplotlib.pyplot. There are clean instructions to follow each step for the beginners. Last update: June 15, 2020


#### 2- Framingham dataset is analyzed with Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplot Libraries. KNN, Logistic Regression, and a One Layer Neural Network are applied to the dataset.
Raw framingham.csv dataset is downloaded from Kaggle. The dataset is cleaned, the feature scoring analysis and pruning is done. 3 different ML algorithms are applied for logistic regression analysis. There are clean instructions to follow each step for the beginners. Last update: September 24, 2020
