This is a repository of teaching materials, code, and data for my data analysis and machine learning projects.

Each repository will (usually) correspond to one of the posts on my [website](http://www.pythonicfool.com/).

Be sure to check the documentation (usually in IPython Notebook format) in the directory you're interested in for the notes on the analysis, data usage terms, etc.

## Exploratory_Data_Analysis_and_ML_Projects


#### 1- [Kaggle Movie Dataset - EDA](https://github.com/volkansonmez/Exploratory_Data_Analysis_and_ML_Projects/tree/master/Movies%20Dataset)
Movie Dataset is analyzed with Pandas and Matplot Libraries.


#### 2- [Framingham Dataset - EDA & ML](https://github.com/volkansonmez/Exploratory_Data_Analysis_and_ML_Projects/tree/master/Framingham%20Dataset) 
Framingham Dataset is analyzed with Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplot Libraries. KNN, Logistic Regression Classifier, and a One Layer Neural Network are applied to the dataset. Raw framingham.csv dataset is downloaded from Kaggle. 3 different ML algorithms are applied for logistic regression analysis. T


#### 3- [MNIST Dataset - EDA & ML](https://github.com/volkansonmez/Exploratory_Data_Analysis_and_ML_Projects/tree/master/MNIST%20Dataset)
Famous MNIST Dataset is analyzed with Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplot Libraries. Pytorch and TF-Keras libraries are used to build models with FCL and CNNs.
The dataset can be downloaded from: https://www.kaggle.com/oddrationale/mnist-in-csv , tf.keras.datasets.mnist, or torchvision.datasets.MNIST


#### 4- [Breast Cancer Dataset - EDA & ML](https://github.com/volkansonmez/Exploratory_Data_Analysis_and_ML_Projects/tree/master/Breast%20Cancer%20Dataset)
 is analyzed with Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplot Libraries. Decision Tree & XGBoost models are trained to make a prediction with 95% and 97% accuracy respectively.
The dataset can be obtained at: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/breast+cancer+wisconsin+%28diagnostic%29


#### 5- [Anomaly Detection - EDA & ML](https://github.com/volkansonmez/Exploratory_Data_Analysis_and_ML_Projects/tree/master/Anomaly%20Detection%20Dataset)
Temperature anomaly is analyzed with Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplot Libraries. Kmeans++ is used to cluster the data and basic adtk tool is used to see the anomalities. The dataset can be obtained at: https://www.kaggle.com/boltzmannbrain/nab
This is a timeseries dataset showing hourly temperature values for one year


#### 6- [Time Series Stock Dataset - EDA & ML](https://github.com/volkansonmez/Exploratory_Data_Analysis_and_ML_Projects/tree/master/Time%20Series%20Stock%20Data)
is analyzed with Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplot Libraries. FBProphet, ARIMA, and LSTM models (with Keras TF) are used to make predictions.
The dataset can be obtained at: https://finance.yahoo.com/chart/AAPL/
This is a timeseries dataset showing daily stock value changes of APPLE. 


#### 7- [Audio Dataset - EDA & ML](https://github.com/volkansonmez/Exploratory_Data_Analysis_and_ML_Projects/tree/master/Audio%20Dataset)
Several laughters in .wav format are analyzed with Librosa and Matplotlib Libraries. Convolutional NN are used to make predictions.
The dataset can be found in the 'laugh' and 'laugh_test' folders.
There are 22 laughter files in total. Some sound sincere and some sound fake. The gray scale mel spectogram images of the laughter audio files are trained and tested. 


#### 8- [Truck Backer Upper - EDA & ML](https://github.com/volkansonmez/Exploratory_Data_Analysis_and_ML_Projects/tree/master/Truck%20Backer%20Upper%20SSL)
A truck is learning how to park backwards, creating its own training data with emulator and doing its steering with controller.
This notebook is the enhanced version of the copy at the NYU 2020 Deep Learning Class. 


#### 9- [Transformer - ML](https://github.com/volkansonmez/Exploratory_Data_Analysis_and_ML_Projects/tree/master/Transformer) 
A Transformer Encoder is coded from scratch with PyTorch and then trained for performing a sentiment analysis on the torch.datasets.IMDB dataset.


#### 10- [VAE with Yale Database - ML](https://github.com/volkansonmez/Exploratory_Data_Analysis_and_ML_Projects/tree/master/VAE%20with%20Yale%20Database)
Created a Variational Auto Encoder (VAE) and trained it with the Yale Face Database to the model to extract the average facial features of the dataset. This dataset can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/kerneler/starter-yale-face-database-c5f3978b-5
